# Unlockie
I need an app created and coded that is similar to Uber but for locksmiths. I imagine an app that tracks locksmiths while they travel and work. Customers who lock themselves out of the car can open the app, select services needed (unlock car door, unlock house, install, repair, and adjust locks etc) the app will show available locksmiths nearby, the customer can click on them and read reviews, see a picture of the locksmith, access their website etc. And then pick a locksmith. Once a locksmith is selected the locksmith will be alerted and accept or deny request. If accepted the locksmith will accept and send an estimated arrival time. This arrival time will then be sent to the customer and the customer can confirm nor deny the time. Other factors to consider is people will need to be able to pay and accept payment through the app.People will need to create a profile.People will need to be able to choose if they are  registering as a locksmith or someone who needs a locksmith (customer or locksmith)The app should be quick and easy to set up as well as use.
